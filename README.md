# Pneumonia Image Classification

## Description
This project is a deep learning-based image classification model designed to classify chest X-ray images into two categories: Normal and Pneumonia. The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy in pneumonia detection.

## Features
- Binary classification: Normal vs. Pneumonia
- Uses deep learning (CNN) for feature extraction and classification
- Trained on labeled chest X-ray images
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Dataset
- The dataset consists of labeled chest X-ray images categorized as Normal or Pneumonia.
- Ensure the dataset is properly structured in respective directories before training.
